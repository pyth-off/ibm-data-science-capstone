# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

## Introduction

In this capstone project, I will predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of 62 million dollars, significantly less than other providers who charge upwards of 165 million dollars. The cost savings are mainly due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. By predicting the landing success of the first stage, I can estimate the launch cost, providing valuable information for companies competing against SpaceX for rocket launch bids.

This project simulates a real-world data science workflow. As a Data Scientist at a startup competing with SpaceX, I will follow the Data Science methodology, including data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting results to stakeholders. My task is to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage.

## Business Problem

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches for 62 million dollars, while other providers charge upwards of 165 million dollars. The significant savings are due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. Accurate predictions of the first stage's landing success will enable me to determine the launch cost. With these data science insights and models, the startup can make competitive bids against SpaceX for rocket launches.

## Objective

- Apply data science tools and machine learning to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, thereby determining the launch cost.
- Explore the data to gain deeper insights.

## Business Metric

The primary metric for this project is classification accuracy, which is defined as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions:
$$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + TN + FN}$$
